README

CSVtoJSON.py is the main file. Based around what I expected the CSV file to look like, and how I assume the JSON database should look like. 

Let me know if any of this should be changed, including any critiques of my code!

Thanks

EDIT: The CSV and JSON file were based around there only being 8 questions. There are 18, however, and the script is now modified for this. I havenâ€™t modified the CSV or JSON file to model 18 questions, though.
