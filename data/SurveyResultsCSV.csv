However, I am barely able to use it because even if I go out to my stop early, full busses just pass right by even if there's only 1-2 people waiting. I find it very unfair that I am unable to opt out of my UPass (I am forced to walk or get a ride nearly every day because of this issue). Sometimes the busses aren't even half full and they pass by. I also find it funny that they've stopped some busses like the 250 and 49 from stopping at stops close to UBC. WHY. THOSE WERE THE LONG, DOUBLE-BUS ONES THAT WOULD ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE OVERLOAD ON OTHER, SMALLER BUSSES. I get really mad and annoyed when thinking about this, even more so because there is no way to opt out for the average student. It feels like Translink doesn't care about students who live closer to UBC and expect them just to walk, so if they're going to have that attitude they should either compensate by making UPasses for such students cheaper or providing an opt out method for students who live within the UBC area.

GO TO TOLMIE OR SASAMAT INSTEAD. What I'm trying to say is that the Blanca St. bus stop is constantly overcrowded by multiple people that full buses wouldn't stop if there were even three people there. THREE I TELL YOU. On the days where I'm the only one at the bus stop full buses would be fine with taking me on. So...what I'm trying to say is that there are other bus stops to go to. STOP COMING TO BLANCA. It's like the annoying kids in class that try too hard to make friends. They sit next to you when there were FREE CHAIRS EVERYWHERE ELSE, just like the Blanca St. bus stop, THERE ARE OTHERS. It's not too hard to walk over to another one but I'm too lazy to do so myself (I know I'm being hypocritical). I also recommend that people use what I like to call ""The Backpack Strategy"". Whenever you have a class, put the backpack to the seat next to you so nobody has to sit next to you. This is more efficient if you sit on the edge. To possibly go even further and try to block off a whole row (this isn't possible in all places but it's possible in places like WOOD2) pretend that you're asleep and pretend wake up when class starts. I've only done the sleeping thing once but it worked phenomenally, the row was empty for the whole class. It's also much better than being an ass and flat out saying ""Go choose another place to sit"". OH I JUST REALIZED, pretending to sleep won't have people bother you to move your backpack if you pretend to sleep! Only real asswipes (I just realized I censored ""fuck"" in the first sentence but didn't censor ""ass"") would engage in physical contact and try to wake you up. This is actually not a good idea, especially if they are asleep. Ok...I think I'm done for now. TL;DR: Stay away from the Blanca St. bus stop, and avoid social interactions by sleeping and having your backpack in the seat next to you."
